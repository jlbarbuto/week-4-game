# week-4-game

Bertie Botts Every Flavor Bean Collector

Users are given a number at the beginning of the game to aim for. The game is won when the user collects *exactly* the same amount of beans (no more). Users pick one of the four bean piles to add a hidden number to their total. Each pile of beans represents a random number that will stay the same for the entire round. Once a user reaches or goes over the give number, the game restarts with a new goal and new hidden numbers for the bean piles.
